The hope in my mother's eyes shattered me. 

"Please David, for me?" she asked. "Maybe this will help you," she continued, oblivious to the stiffness in my posture and the sudden iciness that had crept into my eyes.

"Help me?" I said sullenly. "How about all the medications? The countless therapists? Did those help?" I continued.

My mind raced, and I barely heard the effect my words had on my mother until she abruptly stamped her foot, like a spoiled child.

"Davy!" she yelled. "Listen. We have no other option. I have no other option. This whole situation?" she said, gesturing to the shattered mirror on the living room floor, "it can't keep on happening."

It was then that I knew I had no choice. My mother never, ever called my "Davy." Davy was my older brother. I had never met him, because he died before I was born. No one told me how, but I had ears and a bad habit of eavesdropping. That, along with the whispers and hushed voices of my relatives when they thought I wasn't looking led me to one word, a dreaded syllable that everyone thought but no one said. 

Suicide.

"David, answer me!" my mother said, breaking my thoughts and hurling me back into the present.

Unable to stop the trembling in my voice, I spoke. "Do I really have a choice?" I asked, already knowing the answer.

My mother hesitated for a moment, but it was enough for me to understand what she meant. I didn't trust myself to speak anymore, so without another word, I ran up to my bedroom. Vaguely, I head the loud slam of my door and the click of the lock on the brass knob as I turned it.

I sat on edge of my bed, caught between a series of conflicting emotions that seemed like they could crush me, puliverizing everything good in my life. I didn't hear Alice until she was beside me. 

Without another word, she hugged me. The fuzz of her sweater caught on the bottom of my eyelids and I swatted at the drops of salted water that clung to the orange fabric.

After a moment, she untangled her arms from my chest and looked at me, desperation shining in her eyes.

"It's happening?" she said.

I couldn't speak anymore, and I didn't try to. Instead, I nodded, curling my knees into my chest and hiding my face between the folds of denim there.

In that moment, there wasn't anything I wanted to do execpt for hide. Hide, and maybe run. I wanted to run away, run and take Alice with me, but I knew there wasn't anywhere to go. 

Alice's voice broke through my thoughts. Alice spoke softly, letting her words flow into the air like a vapor, unlike my mother, whose words pierced it like a spear.

"Can I come with you?" she whispered, more quiet than I'd ever heard before.

For a moment, I wanted to pretend that I hadn't heard her, but my conscience ached, and I found I couldn't ignore her.

"Yes," I said. 

Then, she let go of her physical form and vanished into a cloud of gold. I opened my Soul and let her in, gently closing the gates behind me as she entered.

...

From the camera room, Jay Devore watched intently as David re-absorbed Alice. To everyone else, it would look like nothing had happened. It simply seemed that David was talking to thin air. But Devore had sharp eyes, honed to a deadly edge through years of training and hunting other Souls, and he recognized the telltale signs of an open Soul, as well as the almost invisible mist that flowed into it. 

He was so absorbed in the video that he almost didn't hear his wife come behind him. It wasn't until she reached out a hand to stroke his shoulder that he recognized the warmth of another person and spun around quickly, placing his hands on Macie's temples. Instantly, her eyes became glassy.

"What did you see?" he asked, not bothering to hide the edge in his tone.

"You, and David," she replied. Her voice sounded artificial and she spoke in a monotone.

"What about David?" he insisted.

"I saw him talking to someone that isn't there, on the video camera screen," she said. Already, a hint of human emotion was creeping into her voice. Jay quickly closed the laptop he had been observing David from and hurriedly turned around. In a second, he had closed his Soul, wincing from the sound of the slamming doors inside his chest.

Behind him, his wife, Macie, looked up, confusion clouding her soft features. "What happened, Jay?" she asked, rubbing her temples, where Jay's hands had been just a moment before.

"Nothing, my love," he replied, leaning up to give her a kiss on the cheek. In return, she smiled, forgetting the fuzziness in her head. "We were just talking about options for David."

"Ah, yes," she said. Her smile had been replaced with a look of resignation. The thought of admitting their son, David, into Devore Institute felt too much like giving up. She knew that David's father owned the place, and knew of the pristine reputation and licensure that the place held. Still, some unknown fear nagged her in the back of her mind.

Unable to pinpoint the apprehansive feeling that she had, Macie Devore brushed it off before speaking again.

"He broke a mirror in the living room. Again. Nothing seems to help his violent tendencies, Jay."

Jay sighed and looked down, trying to hide the glee on his face. 

"Does this mean-"

Macie nodded. "Yes. I think we need to admit David into Devore."

Jay found himself smiling, but quickly shifted his features into a look of concern before Macie could notice.

"Okay. If you feel like this is the right choice Mace, I'll stand behind you." In a moment of passion, he took Macie's head in his hands.

"I'll always be beside you. If there's anything I can do to help our son, I'll do it."

Macie smiled tearfully, forcing down the instinctive mistrust that invaded her mind.

"Can we do it tomorrow?"

Excerpt from the Book of Devourers: A Guide to Hunting Souls

Introduction

Often, one can find it hard to define a Soul. I mean, what is it?

Yes, every Devourer worth his salt knows that Souls can be dangerous and that the powers they use differ from person to person. We all understand how their powers work: they create a connection to their power, which is sometimes described as feeling like they are "opening their chest". Once the connection is forged, the Soul then uses it to fight percieved threats, and once these threats are eliminated, the Soul then ends the connection, like closing a gate. 

But still, that doesn't really answer the question: What is a Soul and where does it come from?

In my opinion, having killed and imprisoned thousands of Souls throughout my career, here is my definition: 

A Soul is a being that looks and acts human. It could, in fact, be mistaken for a human except for two things: a Soul is immortal and never ages past approximately 20 years old, and a Soul has inhuman abilities that, as mentioned above, vary from person to person. 

Now, for the real question: How do we, as Devourers, or warriors dedicated to ending the existence of Souls, fight them?
